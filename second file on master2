Hello All, I am working on https://predix2.jenkins.build.ge.com/ and trying to deploy a simple nodejs application on aws ec2 instance. unfortunately ssh to my ec2 instance is failing saying 'connection refused'. I tried changing the port specifically to 80/443, but i got the same result. Apart from that i read in internet regarding chisel-a http tunneling tool that can be used on docker instance, but i am really not sure if my setup is wrong , its simply not working. i believe that all the issues are because of proxy settings, but i am not understanding how to set proxy on a linux terminal for the ssh , 
just the way we set the proxy on putty ssh client.
