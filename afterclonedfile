this is my first commoit on this file after cloned to local
and pushing to remote locatytion
When working with other people's repositories, there are a few basic Git commands to remember:

git clone
git fetch
git merge
git pull
These commands are very useful when interacting with a remote repository. clone and fetch download remote code from a repository's remote URL to your local computer, merge is used to merge different people's work together with yours, and pull is a combination of fetch and merge.
